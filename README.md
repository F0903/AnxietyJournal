# AnxietyJournal

[![CI](https://github.com/F0903/AnxietyJournal/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/F0903/AnxietyJournal/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A simple tool for taking note of when you are anxious, or journaling anxiety-provoking events.

You can find the latest installer under the releases tab :)

NOTE:
As of writing, the CI will always fail due to a (possible) bug in a library it is using. The app does actually work and run fine.
