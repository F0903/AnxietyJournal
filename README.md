# AnxietyJournal

[![CI](https://github.com/F0903/AnxietyJournal/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/F0903/AnxietyJournal/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A simple tool for taking note of when you are anxious, or journaling anxiety-provoking events.

NOTE:
As of writing, the CI will always fail due to a (possible) bug in a library it is using. The app does actually work and run fine. 
This does mean that the only way to install the app, is to build it yourself, and run the installer. Sorry for the inconvenience.
